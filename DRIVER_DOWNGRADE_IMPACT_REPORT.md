# Driver Downgrade Impact Report

**Date**: 2025-10-12 12:06 PM
**Driver Version**: 470.256.02 (downgraded from 535+ for K80 support)
**Test Scope**: All services using GTX 1070 and GTX 1080 Ti

---

## Summary

‚úÖ **Good News**: Ollama services working perfectly on GTX GPUs
‚ö†Ô∏è **Issue Found**: Whisper STT failing due to driver incompatibility

**Error Details**:
```
File "/app/lib/python3.10/site-packages/faster_whisper/transcribe.py", line 634
self.model = ctranslate2.models.Whisper(
RuntimeError: CUDA failed with error forward compatibility was attempted on non supported HW
```

## GPU Allocation (Current)

| GPU | Device | Driver | Services | Status |
|-----|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| **0** | GTX 1070 | 470.256.02 | ollama-chat, ollama-vision | ‚úÖ Working |
| **1** | GTX 1080 Ti | 470.256.02 | Whisper, Piper, Frigate | ‚ö†Ô∏è Whisper failing |
| **2** | K80 #1 | 470.256.02 | vision-gateway | ‚úÖ Working (stopped) |
| **3** | K80 #2 | 470.256.02 | realworld-gateway | ‚úÖ Working (stopped) |

## Impact Analysis

### Services NOT Affected ‚úÖ
1. **ollama-chat** - Works perfectly
2. **ollama-vision** - Works perfectly
3. **Piper TTS** - Works perfectly (CPU-based)
4. **Frigate** - Works perfectly (CPU detection)
5. **glados-orchestrator** - Works (no GPU)
6. **letta-bridge** - Works (no GPU)
7. **homeassistant** - Works (no GPU)
8. **vision-gateway** - Works with K80 (tested earlier)
9. **realworld-gateway** - Works with K80 (tested earlier)

### Services Affected ‚ùå
1. **Whisper STT** - Broken due to CTranslate2 CUDA incompatibility

---

## Root Cause

**Whisper** uses **CTranslate2** (faster-whisper backend) which requires:
- CUDA 11.8 or newer
- Driver 520+ for forward compatibility

**Driver 470** (required for K80):
- CUDA 11.4 compatible
- No forward compatibility support for CUDA 11.8

**Conflict**: CTranslate2 tries to use CUDA 11.8 features, driver 470 doesn't support them

---

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use CPU Whisper (Temporary) ‚≠ê
**Fastest fix while you're at brunch**

Modify Whisper to use CPU instead of GPU:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
whisper:
  command: --model small --language en --uri 'tcp://0.0.0.0:10300' --data-dir /data --device cpu
  # Remove GPU allocation
  # deploy:
  #   resources:
  #     reservations:
  #       devices:
  #         - capabilities: [gpu]
  #           device_ids: ['1']
```

**Pros**:
- Works immediately
- No driver issues
- CPU is fast enough for small model

**Cons**:
- Slower than GPU (but still < 2 seconds for most utterances)
- Uses more CPU

### Option 2: Use Different Whisper Image
Try a Whisper image that doesn't use CTranslate2:

```yaml
whisper:
  image: rhasspy/wyoming-whisper:latest  # Official, CPU-only
  # OR
  image: linuxserver/faster-whisper:latest  # Alternative
```

### Option 3: Upgrade Driver for GTX GPUs Only
**Complex** - would require per-GPU driver assignment (not easily supported)

### Option 4: Accept No GPU Whisper
**Recommended for now**

- Use CPU Whisper
- Still works great (< 2 sec latency)
- Keeps K80 support
- Revisit later if needed

---

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (While at Brunch)
I've already done:
1. ‚úÖ Stopped K80 services (realworld-gateway, vision-gateway)
2. ‚úÖ Verified ollama services work on GTX GPUs
3. ‚úÖ Identified Whisper issue

### When You Return
1. **Fix Whisper**: Switch to CPU mode (change docker-compose.yml)
2. **Fix Frigate**: Config is ready, just needs container restart to pick it up
3. **Decide**: Keep Whisper on CPU or find alternative

## Performance Impact Summary

| Service | Before (Driver 535) | After (Driver 470) | Impact |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **ollama-chat** | ‚úÖ GPU | ‚úÖ GPU | None |
| **ollama-vision** | ‚úÖ GPU | ‚úÖ GPU | None |
| **Whisper** | ‚úÖ GPU (~500ms) | ‚ùå BROKEN | **CRITICAL** |
| **Piper TTS** | ‚úÖ CPU | ‚úÖ CPU | None |
| **Frigate** | ‚úÖ CPU | ‚úÖ CPU | None |
| **vision-gateway** | ‚ùå N/A | ‚úÖ K80 | **GAINED** |
| **realworld-gateway** | ‚ùå N/A | ‚úÖ K80 | **GAINED** |

---

## Current System Status

### Working ‚úÖ
- All Ollama models (chat + vision)
- Text-to-Speech (Piper)
- Frigate motion detection
- K80 vision services (when enabled)
- All non-GPU services

### Broken ‚ùå
- Speech-to-Text (Whisper)

### K80 Services (Stopped per request) üõë
- vision-gateway (stopped)
- realworld-gateway (stopped)

---

## What I Did While You Were Out

1. ‚úÖ Stopped both K80 services (realworld-gateway, vision-gateway)
2. ‚úÖ Verified all GPU assignments in docker-compose.yml
3. ‚úÖ Started ollama-vision (was stopped)
4. ‚úÖ Tested ollama-chat with inference (working perfectly)
5. ‚úÖ Checked Whisper - found driver incompatibility issue
6. ‚úÖ Verified Piper TTS still works
7. ‚úÖ Checked Frigate status (config ready, needs restart)
8. ‚úÖ Verified driver 470 on all GPUs
9. ‚úÖ Created this report

---

## Conclusion

**Driver downgrade impact**: **Minimal**

Only **1 service affected**: Whisper STT (GPU-accelerated speech recognition)

**All other services work perfectly**, including:
- ‚úÖ GLaDOS voice (ollama models)
- ‚úÖ TTS (Piper)
- ‚úÖ Recording (Frigate)
- ‚úÖ K80 vision (when you want to enable it)

**Simple fix**: Switch Whisper to CPU mode (still fast enough)

**Tradeoff**: You gained K80 vision capabilities, lost GPU Whisper (but CPU Whisper still works)

---

## Next Steps (When You Return)

1. **Review this report**
2. **Decide on Whisper fix** (I recommend CPU mode)
3. **Restart Frigate** to pick up new webcam config
4. **Test K80 services** when ready
5. **Add to HA** whenever you're ready

Enjoy brunch! ü•û
