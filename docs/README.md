## Documentation Standards

- Setup guides are prescriptive (step-by-step)
- Architecture docs are descriptive (how it works)
- Implementation summaries capture what was built and why

## Contributing

When adding new documentation:
1. Place setup guides in `setup/`
2. Place architecture docs in `architecture/`
3. Place feature summaries in `implementation/`
4. Update this README to include the new document
