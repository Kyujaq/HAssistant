# Crew Orchestrator Integration - Night Work Summary

**Date**: October 11, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ Ready for Testing Tomorrow

## What Was Done Tonight

### üéØ Main Achievement
Integrated **Crew Orchestrator** - a three-agent system for autonomous PC control using voice commands and vision verification.

### üì¶ New Components Created

1. **services/crew-orchestrator/**
   - `main.py` - FastAPI service with CrewAI agents
   - `crew_tools.py` - Voice command & vision verification tools
   - `Dockerfile` - Optimized, secure container
   - `requirements.txt` - CrewAI + dependencies
   - `README.md` - Full documentation
   - `QUICKSTART.md` - 5-minute setup guide

2. **shared/** (New Directory)
   - `voice.py` - Windows Voice Control bridge
   - `vision.py` - Vision Gateway client (uses cache & memory from today!)
   - Shared across all services

3. **Documentation**
   - `PC_CONTROL_TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive 300+ line guide
   - Covers hardware setup, testing steps, troubleshooting
   - Includes crew orchestrator usage section

4. **Docker Integration**
   - Added to `docker-compose.yml` as commented service (opt-in)
   - Port 8084, health checks, non-root security
   - Volume mounts for shared modules

### ü§ñ Three-Agent System

**Agent 1: Planner**
- Breaks goals into step-by-step plans
- Application-aware (Excel, Chrome, Notepad, etc.)
- Generates voice commands + verification questions

**Agent 2: Action Agent**
- Executes voice commands via Windows Voice Control
- Routes through: TTS ‚Üí USB audio ‚Üí Windows Voice Assistant
- One action at a time, waits for completion

**Agent 3: Verifier**
- Checks if action succeeded using Vision Gateway
- Uses detection cache (benefits from today's work!)
- Can answer yes/no questions about screen state

### üîÑ How It Works

```
User sends goal:
  "Create Excel spreadsheet with Name, Age, Email columns"

‚Üì Planner breaks down:
  Step 1: "Open Excel" + verify "Is Excel open?"
  Step 2: "Click cell A1" + verify "Is A1 selected?"
  Step 3: "Type Name" + verify "Does A1 show Name?"
  Step 4: "Press Tab" + verify "Is A2 selected?"
  Step 5: "Type Age" + verify "Does A2 show Age?"
  ... etc

‚Üì Action Agent executes each step via voice

‚Üì Verifier checks using vision cache

‚Üì Self-corrects if verification fails
```

### üé® Made It Generic (Not Just Excel!)

Original branch was Excel-only. Tonight's updates:
- ‚úÖ Added `application` parameter to API
- ‚úÖ Updated planner to understand any Windows app
- ‚úÖ Created `/crew/task/kickoff` generic endpoint
- ‚úÖ Kept `/crew/excel/kickoff` for compatibility
- ‚úÖ Vision verification knows about Excel, Chrome, Notepad, etc.

### üîí Security & Optimization

- Non-root container (user: crewuser, UID 1000)
- Read-only volume mounts
- Health checks (15s start period)
- Environment variable validation
- Python bytecode disabled (PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE)
- Layer caching optimized in Dockerfile

### üëÅÔ∏è Vision Gateway Integration

The verifier agent uses Vision Gateway with:
- ‚úÖ Detection cache (from today's updates!)
- ‚úÖ Heuristic matching (can be upgraded to Ollama vision later)
- ‚úÖ Contextual answers with confidence scores
- ‚úÖ Recent detection history

Example verification questions:
- "Is Excel open?" ‚Üí checks for "excel" in window titles
- "Is cell A1 selected?" ‚Üí future enhancement
- "Does screen show a button?" ‚Üí checks action states

## üß™ Testing Plan for Tomorrow

### Phase 1: Basic Voice Control (5 min)
```bash
cd /home/qjaq/HAssistant/clients
python3 windows_voice_control.py "Open Notepad"
```
**Expected**: Notepad opens on Windows PC

### Phase 2: Crew Orchestrator Planning (10 min)
```bash
# Uncomment crew-orchestrator in docker-compose.yml
docker compose build crew-orchestrator
docker compose up -d crew-orchestrator

# Test planning
curl -X POST http://localhost:8084/crew/task/kickoff \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"goal": "Open Notepad and type Hello", "application": "Notepad"}'
```
**Expected**: Returns step-by-step plan

### Phase 3: Vision Verification (10 min)
```bash
# Open something on Windows PC
python3 windows_voice_control.py "Open Calculator"

# Check vision gateway
curl http://localhost:8088/api/detections

# Ask verifier question
# (This needs crew orchestrator API call - TBD)
```
**Expected**: Vision detects application state

### Phase 4: Multi-Step Automation (20 min)
Test with Excel:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8084/crew/task/kickoff \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "goal": "Create Excel spreadsheet with Name and Age columns",
    "application": "Excel"
  }'
```
**Expected**: Full plan with 5-10 steps
