- Docker networking configured
- Service health checks operational

### Outstanding Action Items ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. **Home Assistant Integration** - Manual steps required:
   - Add Whisper integration (port 10300)
   - Add Piper integration (port 10400)
   - Configure Assist pipeline with GLaDOS Hermes
   - Set up wake word with Porcupine on Pi

2. **Pi Client Deployment**
   - Deploy wake word detection to Raspberry Pi
   - Configure network settings
   - Test end-to-end voice interaction

## Vision Gateway Feedback

### Configuration Tuning Needed
Based on `vision-gateway/app/main.py`:
- Button detection thresholds may need environment-specific tuning
- HDMI capture parameters should be validated in production
- Consider frame processing optimization (currently every 3rd frame)

### Recommendations
1. Document optimal threshold values for different display configurations
2. Add calibration mode for button detection
3. Implement adaptive threshold adjustment

## Database Schema & Legacy Compatibility

### Implementation Notes
From `scripts/03_legacy_schema.sql`:
- Dual-write triggers implemented for backward compatibility
- Legacy endpoints preserved (`/assistant` routes)
- Analytics tables maintained for historical data

### Future Cleanup
- Evaluate usage of legacy endpoints after 6 months
- Consider deprecation timeline for old schema
- Plan migration path for legacy data consumers

## General Action Items

### Documentation
- [x] Memory integration documented
- [x] Wyoming setup guide complete
- [ ] Add troubleshooting runbook for common issues
- [ ] Document scaling considerations
- [ ] Create architecture diagrams

### Testing
- [x] Integration tests for memory service
- [x] Verification script (39 checks)
- [ ] Load testing for memory search
- [ ] End-to-end voice pipeline tests
- [ ] Vision gateway accuracy benchmarks

### DevOps
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Automate deployment process
- [ ] Configure log aggregation
- [ ] Implement metrics collection
- [ ] Create runbook for incident response

## Security Considerations Consolidated

### Immediate Actions Required ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. ‚úÖ Change all default passwords in `.env.example` (COMPLETED - now use CHANGE_ME_* placeholders)
2. ‚úÖ Rotate API keys from development defaults (COMPLETED - docker-compose.yml updated)
3. ‚úÖ Review Redis password security (COMPLETED - placeholder updated)
4. ‚úÖ Review PostgreSQL password security (COMPLETED - placeholder updated)
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Before production deployment:
   - Generate and set strong passwords for all services
   - Set unique BRIDGE_API_KEY
   - Enable TLS/SSL for external-facing services
   - Implement rate limiting

### Recent Security Improvements (PR#8)
- All `.env.example` passwords changed to obvious placeholders (CHANGE_ME_*)
- Added comprehensive security warnings and password generation commands
- Fixed hardcoded API key in docker-compose.yml (glados-orchestrator)
- Fixed default passwords in docker-compose.yml for postgres, redis, frigate
- Added startup warnings in services/letta-bridge/main.py for dev-key and fake_embed()
- Enhanced fake_embed() documentation with clear production warnings

### Production Readiness
1. Enable TLS/SSL for all external-facing services
2. Implement rate limiting on Letta Bridge API
3. Set up API gateway with authentication
4. Configure network segmentation
5. Enable audit logging
6. Implement secrets management (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)

## Performance Optimization Notes

### Memory Service
- Vector search optimized with IVFFlat indexing
- Current embedding dimension: 1536 (OpenAI compatible)
- Redis caching enabled with AOF persistence
- Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection

### Bottlenecks Identified
1. Fake embedding function (CPU-bound) - needs GPU acceleration
2. Vision gateway frame processing - already optimized with downsampling
3. Database queries - indexes created, may need tuning with scale

## Integration Testing Results

### Memory Integration
```
‚úì All 39 checks passed (verified 2024-01-XX)
- Docker Compose configuration
- Service files present
- Database initialization
- Environment variables
- Documentation complete
- Test infrastructure
```

### Configuration Fixes (PR#8)
‚úì Fixed letta-bridge port mapping (8081:8081 instead of 8081:8000)
‚úì Fixed glados-orchestrator LETTA_BRIDGE_URL to use correct port (8081)
‚úì Updated all default passwords to clear placeholders
‚úì Removed hardcoded API key from glados-orchestrator

### Known Issues
None reported in recent testing.

## Breaking Changes

**Memory Integration**: None - new feature addition
**Wyoming Protocol**: None - additive only
**Vision Gateway**: Configuration changes may require retuning

## Migration Guide

### For New Installations
- Follow QUICK_START.md
- Use MEMORY_INTEGRATION.md for memory features
- Configure Wyoming per WYOMING_SETUP.md

### For Existing Deployments
- Memory services can be added without affecting existing components
- Legacy endpoints remain functional
- No database migrations required for core functionality

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Letta Bridge Not Starting
```bash
docker compose logs letta-bridge
# Check PostgreSQL readiness, Redis password, port conflicts
```

#### Vector Search Issues
```bash
# Verify pgvector extension
docker exec hassistant-postgres psql -U hassistant -d hassistant \
  -c "SELECT * FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'vector';"
```

#### Slow Performance
```bash
# Reindex and analyze
docker exec hassistant-postgres psql -U hassistant -d hassistant -c "
REINDEX INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_memory_embeddings_vector;
ANALYZE memory_embeddings;
"
```
